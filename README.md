# MySQL Employee Tracker

## Project Description

This project was designed for building and managing a database to keep track of employees, their roles, and the departments they work at. The project was based on the use of mySQL, as well as inquirer, and the console table. 

Throughout the process, my main challenge besides being past the due date, was the different ways to make use of inquirer and take the best advantage possible.

## Technologies used

* MySQL
* Inquirer
* Node.js
* Console.table

## Install and run

To make use of this application, you do need to clone it in your personal computer, and once it has been opened on your code editor, you open the integrated terminal and type in the following commands:

```
npm i
mysql -u root
```
MySQL should open now and you type in the following:
```
SOURCE SQL/schema.sql;
SOURCE SQL/seed.sql;
```
Once your database information has been seeded you should just type in the following command:
```
node server.js
```
And some prompts should pop up for you on the terminal, givving you the freedom to view all departments in the database, employees, and their info. You also have the option to update their status, and add departments, employees, etc. You can also simply log out and thats all about it!
